# NordGuide

## Overview
**NordGuide** is a Valheim mod that adds an immersive **compass UI** at the top of the screen.
It displays the cardinal directions (N/E/S/W) and **minimap POIs** (shrines, pings, etc.) aligned
to the camera heading — with dynamic size and smooth distance-based fading.
It displays all the minimap icons in the compass UI(mod icons included)
