# NordGuide

**NordGuide** is a lightweight **Valheim** mod that adds a clean, Skyrim-styled guidance layer to exploration: a subtle compass, useful markers, and contextual tips that never clutter your screen. Find your way with style—from your first campfire to the far edges of the world.

---

## ✨ Overview

- **Minimal UI** with a Nordic look & feel.  
- **Subtle compass/guide** to aid navigation.  
- **Helpful markers & hints** focused on quality-of-life, not spoilers.  
- **Low overhead**, friendly for modpacks.

> Goal: enhance orientation without turning Valheim into a GPS.
